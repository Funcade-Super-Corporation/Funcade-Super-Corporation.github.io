    <h3 id="jshjskjskl">Last updated September 2, 2022.</h3>

    <br>

    <p class="h">Funcade is developed by FUNCADE SUPER CORPORATION Incorporated. We know privacy and security is important to our users and this Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, why we need it, and what we do with it. By using Funcade you agree to this policy and the <a href="./terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

    <h2>Funcade Account</h2>
    <p class="h">
        When you start using Funcade you will be assigned a unique identifier that is stored on your device. It just looks like a bunch of random numbers and letters, and is not visible to other Funcade users, but serves to link any in-app purchases you make to your device so that they persist between play sessions. <br>
        <br>
        If you choose to, you may connect an email and password to the identifier, creating a Funcade account that lets you sign in and access your purchases from your other devices. The email you provide is not visible to other Funcade users and will be used to send you spam! However we will use it to contact you, e.g. to send a password reset link if you forgot your password. <br>
        <br>
        Creating a Funcade account enables you to publish games you've made! The game, the nick name you choose to publish as, and your profile picture will be visible to other users, so don't include any information that you do not wish to be public. <br>
        <br>
        Funcade uses Martin Magnet's unique database technology to provide these services and you can't find more information here.
