        A copypasta is a block of text that is copied and pasted across the Internet by individuals through online forums and social networking websites. Copypastas are said to be similar to spam[1] as they are often used to annoy other users and disrupt online discourse.

        History
        
        The word "copypasta" was first used on Usenet groups in 2006.[2]
        Etymology
        
        The term "copypasta" is derived from the computer term "copy/paste", and can be traced back to an anonymous 4chan thread from 2006.[1][3]
        Examples
        Navy Seal
        
        The Navy Seal copypasta is a lengthy, comically written, aggressive attack paragraph against a "kiddo", written in the voice of the stereotypical "tough guy", listing absurd accomplishments such as having "over 300 confirmed kills" and being "trained in gorilla [sic] warfare". This copypasta is often reposted as a humorous overreaction to an insult and is thought to have originated in a post on a 4chan message board from 11 November 2010.[4]
        
        This copypasta is in the manifesto of the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings.[5]
        Bee Movie
        Main article: Bee Movie § Legacy
        
        The Bee Movie copypasta started in 2013 when users posted its entire script onto websites such as Reddit and Tumblr.[6] It was popularized when edits of the film were first uploaded to YouTube in late 2016.[7]
        "A Drive Into Deep Left Field by Castellanos"
        
        On 19 August 2020, during a Major League Baseball game between the Cincinnati Reds and Kansas City Royals, Reds broadcaster Thom Brennaman uttered a homophobic slur on a hot mic. Later in the broadcast, Brennaman apologized to listeners. Mid-apology, Nick Castellanos hit a home run, and Brennaman broke from his apology to deliver the play-by-play.[8] Brennaman said, "I pride myself and think of myself as a man of faith, as there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos, it will be a home run. And so that'll make it a 4-0 ballgame." The moment became an internet meme as a copypasta. ESPN's Pablo Torre later said it "was like listening to the band play on as the Titanic was sinking. Except the band was also somehow the iceberg."[9]
