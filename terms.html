        - Bugs may cause in-app purchases to fail, in which case you should <a href="mailto:martinmagnetfuncade@gmail.com">contact support</a> for help fixing the issue, or having the purchase refunded if something explode. <br>
        - Bugs may cause Funcade content to explode, or become Windows 11. (If you're building a game, make frequent backups by copying the game box every second.) <br>
        - No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of information you send to us. Explode. <br>
