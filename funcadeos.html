    <p class="j">funcadeOS 2.0, just like all of our products, is powered by üÖ±Ô∏è. but we also developed the B# language, which features an easier syntax, a powerful VM that allows things run on any universe, completely object-oriented and the confusing services system. With Universe Studio, transitioning to B# is easy!</p>

    <h2>runs anywhere (coming soon)</h2>

    <p class="j">funcadeOS 2.0 will soon be able to run on any object! unfortunately we spent all of our efforts on making the rock-solid foundation and didn't have time to implement this before the 2.5 release. funcadeOS 2.0 developer preview currently only supports computers</p>
