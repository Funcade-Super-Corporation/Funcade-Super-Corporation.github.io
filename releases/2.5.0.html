    <h1>New features</h1>

    <h2>More lore</h2>
    <p class="h">It isn't great</p>

    <h2>All-new OS edition</h2>

    <p class="h">This is one of the most exciting features! Funcade OS Edition has been completely rewritten, now renamed to FuncadeOS! FuncadeOS 2.0 features an all-new user interface, the new powerful B# language and virtual machine, and great apps! It currently only supports computers, and isn't that stable, but we made a developer preview! <a href="../funcadeos.html">More info</a></p>

    <h2>Export games to executables</h2>

    <p class="h">Yes, that's right! Now you can take your Funcade game and make it work outside of Funcade with the click of 2 buttons!</p>

    <h2>Funcade Beta Program</h2>

    <p class="h">Help us make Funcade better by joining the Funcade Beta Program and testing broken Funcade versions!</p>

    <h2>Daily rewards</h2>

    <p class="h">Someone on the street said "if you're making a mobile game you should add daily rewards to force people to open your game every day and look at the ads" and i did it</p>

    <h2>Get ice cream every time you login</h2>

    <p class="h">In real life!</p>
